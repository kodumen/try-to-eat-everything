# TRY to EAT EVERYTHING
Welcome to the game, TRY to EAT EVERYTHING. In this game you are a pale-brown colored thing whose sole purpose in life is to eat everything that appears on the screen. Make the best out of your short, pitiful life and get the highest score by guiding yourself towards the not-so-special meal that are green peas. Be careful though for not everything can be eaten that easily. With no other purpose in life, red enemies are there to obstruct your path and give you an instant death that you truly deserve. However, not all hope is lost. There exist a special way to make even the toughest enemy run away from you.

Please enjoy the game and do not hesitate to give your feedback.
